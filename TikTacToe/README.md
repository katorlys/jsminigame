## How to play
Take turns placing your mark (X or O). The first player to align three marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins!  

If the board is filled and no player has aligned three marks, the game ends in a draw.  

You will play as `X`, and the computer will play as `O`.  

### Controls
- Click on a cell to place your mark.

### Goal
Align three of your marks in a row, column, or diagonal to win.
